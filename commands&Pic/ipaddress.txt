Find network id and Broadcast for 150.10.20.30 .


=> Here, the ip address is 150.10.20.30 so, we first have to analyse which ip class does it belongs and,

this belongs to CLASS B ip address. Then, we have to figure out the respective classes of its SubNet and

this Class B have a subnet of 255.255.0.0. Therefore, it do have 2 network bits and 2 host bits.

So, we can conclude that its NETWORK address must be 150.10.0.0 whereas the BROADCAST address must be calculated
from Right to Left pattern, i.e, 150.10.255.255

Also to calculate the total possible number of hosts in this network, we can do as 256*256 - 2 = 65534.

Here, I have subtracted the network address and the broadcast address above. Thus, 65534 host can be only used on that network.
